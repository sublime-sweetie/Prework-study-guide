## Prework Study Guide
A study guide for boot camp prework

## Description


This project serves as a launching point for the UCR Extention bootcamp expereince. The Prework Study Guide is a good way to integrate beginner concepts of HTML, CSS, Git, and javascript. By building this website we get to see our code in action as well as download the programming environment we will use throughout the course. As the course continues there will be a website with notes to refer back to. 


## Installation

Not applicable. 

## Usage

In order to use the Prework Study Guide, we can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing right clicking and selecting "inspect". There is a console panel in the browser that can help you see your code in action. In the Crome DevTool console users will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study.
